### **Extensible C++ Vehicle Simulation: Asset & Package Logic (Chapter 2.1)**

This document outlines the core principles, structure, and implementation details for managing assets and packages within the C++ vehicle simulation architecture. It emphasizes modularity, determinism, and performance, crucial for both Windows development/testing and headless ARM64 production environments. The system is designed to be **Open for Extension, but Closed for Modification (OCP)**, allowing new asset types and configurations without changing core code.

#### **1. Core Architectural Principles & Guidelines for Assets:**

The asset system adheres to several key principles to ensure robustness and efficiency:

*   **Strings only at the edges**: File paths and XML configurations exist at import/build time. **Runtime uses numeric IDs** (e.g., `uint32_t` or `uint64_t`) for everything—assets, types, shaders, systems—ensuring ultra-fast lookups and minimal memory footprint.
*   **Deterministic commits**: Any hot-reloaded changes are **batched and committed at a single "sync point"** (e.g., a frame boundary), preventing mid-frame inconsistencies and ensuring determinism.
*   **Two modes, one codepath**:
    *   **Debug**: Supports **hot-loading XML files** via a file watcher, which are parsed into an Intermediate Representation (IR), built live, and hot-reloaded.
    *   **Release**: XMLs and parametric assets are processed by an **asset compiler** into **compact binary `.pak` files** and optional `.so` plugins. The runtime **memory-maps** these binaries for incredibly fast, deterministic loading by ID.
*   **Thin runtime, fat tools**: Heavy-lifting tasks like validation, parametric meshing, compression, and "cooking" assets occur **off the device** (e.g., on a developer workstation or CI server). The runtime focuses solely on loading, patching, and swapping.

#### **2. Structure Tree Integration (On-Disk Layout):**

The project's file structure is organized to support mini-domains and logical grouping of related code and assets.

```
/assets/
    /packages/
        city_01/
            package.xml             # Declares assets + dependency graph
            meshes/*.obj|*.fbx|*.glb # Source 3D models (debug only)
            textures/*.png|*.ktx2   # Source textures
            params/*.xml            # Parametric definitions (buildings, terrain, furniture)
            code/*.cpp              # Optional plugin code modules (component logic)
            ...
    /build_tools/
        asset_compiler/         # CLI tool: XML -> IR -> cooked binaries
        codegen/                # Generates headers/tables for IDs
    /runtime/
        data/
            packs/
                city_01.pak         # Binary pack for release
            plugins/
                lib_city_01.so      # Runtime plugin(s), stable C ABI
            cache/                  # Shader/geometry/thumbnail caches
                shader_cache/
                geom_cache/
                thumb_index/        # content-hash -> offsets, timestamps
```
This structure emphasizes a **data-driven approach**, where XML files define scene configurations, component parameters, and asset properties, crucial for extensibility.

#### **3. Asset Identity & Lookup (String-Free Runtime):**

To achieve high performance and determinism, the runtime avoids string lookups:

*   **Stable IDs**: Each asset is identified by a `uint32_t` (or `uint64_t`) `AssetId`. These are generated by the **asset compiler** using a perfect hash or assigned index table.
*   **Autogenerated Header/Table**: A small binary table or an autogenerated header maps compile-time symbolic names to these `AssetId`s for code use.
*   **AssetRegistry**: Stores `{AssetId -> ResourceHandle}` with reference counts, without storing strings in runtime tables.

#### **4. Intermediate Representation (IR) and Binary Pack Format:**

The asset compiler transforms XML into an in-memory **Intermediate Representation (IR)**, which is then used to either build live resources (debug) or "cook" them into a `.pak` binary pack (release):

*   **`.pak` Layout (Memory-Mappable)**:
    *   **Header**: Magic number, version, sections count.
    *   **Section Directory**: Fixed offsets for `ASSET_TABLE` (mapping `AssetId` to type, offset, size, flags), `GEOMETRY` (mesh buffers), `MATERIALS`, `TEXTURES`, `PARAMS` (prebaked parameter blocks), `SHADERS`, and `META` (hashes, build info).
*   **Cooking Process**:
    *   **Geometry**: Applies quantization, mesh reordering (e.g., `meshoptimizer` style), generates multi-LODs, and stores data in Structure of Arrays (SoA) for vectorized uploads.
    *   **Textures**: Precompresses to device-friendly formats (e.g., ETC2/KTX2/Basis UASTC).
    *   **Parametric Assets (XML → geometry/logic)**: The asset compiler **executes param generators** (which must be deterministic) to produce final meshes or small parameter blocks + recipe opcode streams for runtime procedural expansion (prefer fully cooked for max speed).

#### **5. Integration with C++ Codebase:**

The integration of XML-defined assets and configurations into the C++ architecture follows IoC, ECS, and Event-Driven Communication principles:

1.  **XML Parsing and Data Loading**: A dedicated **XML parsing module** (e.g., using TinyXML2 or RapidXML) loads XML files from `packages/` and `world_gen/` directories. Parsed data is loaded into appropriate **data structures** (e.g., `SceneConfig`, `ComponentConfig`, `AssetParams`).
2.  **ECS Integration (Entities and Components)**:
    *   Parsed component XML data (e.g., `drone_x1_components.xml`) is consumed by an **Entity Factory** or **Vehicle Spawner** system.
    *   When an `AerichalVehicle` (an ECS entity) is created, the factory reads the XML config, instantiates necessary **Components** (e.g., `PropulsionUnitC`, `BatteryC`, `SensorsC`), and attaches them.
    *   Each component's data members are **populated directly from the parsed XML values**, making vehicle behavior data-driven.
3.  **IoC and Dependency Injection**:
    *   Systems rely on **abstractions (interfaces)**. The IoC Container (or "Poor Man's DI" approach) uses **constructor injection** to provide concrete component instances (initialized from XML data) to systems like `PhysicsSystem` or `WorldGenSystem`. This allows systems to perform calculations using XML-defined parameters without knowing their origin.
    *   For example, `WorldGenSystem` would be injected with `SceneConfig` data, enabling it to generate the environment according to XML specifications.
4.  **Asset Loading and Management**: XML files define paths to 3D models, textures, shaders, and sounds. An **AssetLoader** service reads these paths, uses underlying libraries (e.g., SDL2, OpenGL ES) to load raw asset data, and makes them available to systems like `VisualizationSystem`. Optimizations like Object Pooling, Spatial Partitioning, and LOD are applied.
5.  **Event-Driven Communication**: Components and systems, configured by XML, can **subscribe to events** published to the `global EventBus` (e.g., `BatteryLow`, `HardImpact`).

#### **6. Two Modes: Debug Path (XML Hot-Reload) & Release Path (Binary Packs + Plugins):**

*   **Debug Path (XML Hot-Reload)**:
    *   A **file watcher** detects changes to XML files.
    *   On change, the system parses the XML, validates it, converts it to IR, and runs the **exact same "cook passes"** as the asset compiler.
    *   Resources are built into a **staging registry**.
    *   At the `EndOfFrame` (after `VisualizationSystem`), an **atomic commit** occurs: registry pointers are swapped (double-buffering), ECS handles are repointed, and a `HotReloadEvent` is emitted.
    *   **Determinism Rule**: Live registries are never mutated mid-frame.
*   **Release Path (Binary Packs + Plugins)**:
    *   An **Asset compiler** (CLI tool) converts `packages/*` into `*.pak` binary packs.
    *   Code modules (`code/*.cpp`) are cross-compiled into `lib_*.so` plugins for ARM64.
    *   The runtime's `AssetPackLoader` **memory-maps** `.pak` files and registers sections.
    *   A `PluginManager` scans `/runtime/data/plugins/` and uses `dlopen()` to load each `.so` plugin. Plugins export a **stable C ABI** for registration.
    *   **No JIT on device**: Pre-built `.so` files are preferred due to tight ARM64 memory/CPU budgets.

#### **7. IoC/DI & ECS Integration with Assets (Code Examples):**

The asset system integrates seamlessly with IoC and ECS:

*   **IoC Container**: Built at boot with core services (`AssetRegistry`, `Physics`, `WorldGenApi`, etc.). The `PluginManager` constructs **child containers** for plugins, which register factories and systems via interfaces. Dependencies are injected via constructors.
    *   **Example (Pseudocode)**:
        ```cpp
        struct INoise : Interface { virtual float sample(float2 p)=0; };

        struct TerrainGen : ITerrainGen { TerrainGen(INoise& n, IJobSystem& jobs); ... }

        void CityPluginRegister(PluginApi* api) {
            api->RegisterFactory([] (IContainer& c) { return new PerlinNoise(...); });
            api->RegisterFactory([] (IContainer& c) {
                return new TerrainGen(c.get(), c.get());
            });
            api->RegisterSystem(&CityTrafficSystemDesc); // system depends on ITerrainGen
        }
        ```
*   **ECS with Dynamic Components**: A `PluginComponent` pattern allows for dynamic data:
    *   `struct PluginComponent { ComponentTypeId type; void* data; const ComponentVTable* vtbl; }`
    *   `ComponentVTable` holds function pointers (`onAdd`, `onRemove`, `serialize`, `tick`).
*   **Entity/Vehicle Factory**: Extended to accept `ComponentBlueprint` (from XML or baked pack). It looks up `ComponentTypeId` by numeric ID, allocates component storage via the plugin's `onAdd()`, and passes in the **binary param block** (not strings).

#### **8. Affected Files & Code Examples:**

The assets logic primarily affects the following types of files and modules:

*   **XML Configuration Files**:
    *   `packages/<package_name>/package.xml`
    *   `packages/<package_name>/params/*.xml` (e.g., `building_city_block.xml`, `drone_x1_components.xml`, `table.xml`)
*   **Binary Asset Files (Release)**:
    *   `runtime/data/packs/<package_name>.pak`
    *   `runtime/data/plugins/lib_<plugin_name>.so`
*   **C++ Source Files / Modules**:
    *   **`asset_compiler` (CLI tool)**: Responsible for `xml -> IR -> cooked binaries`.
    *   **`codegen` module**: Generates headers/tables for `AssetId`s.
    *   **XML Parsing Module**: Loads and parses XMLs into data structures.
    *   **`AssetPackLoader`**: Memory-maps `.pak` files and registers sections.
    *   **`PluginManager`**: Scans, loads (`dlopen`), and manages plugins, constructing child IoC containers.
    *   **`AssetRegistry`**: Stores `AssetId -> ResourceHandle` mappings.
    *   **Entity/Vehicle Factory**: Consumes `ComponentBlueprints` (binary param blobs, TypeIds).
    *   **`BootstrapSystem`**: One-shot system to load core packs, build IoC, load plugins, construct world.
    *   **`AssetHotReloadSystem`**: End-of-frame system for debug hot-reloading (file watching, cooking to staging, atomic commit).
    *   **`main.cpp` / `SimApp.cpp`**: Orchestrates the main loop, including `BootstrapSystem` and `AssetHotReloadSystem`.
    *   **Core Systems (`PhysicsSystem`, `WorldGenSystem`, `VehicleControlSystem`)**: Consume asset data and interfaces injected via IoC.
    *   **Component Implementations (`PropulsionUnitC`, `BatteryC`, `SensorsC`, etc.)**: Their data members are populated from XML/binary pack configs.

*   **Code Examples for Plugin API and Hot-Reload System**:

    ```cpp
    // Plugin API (Shared between engine and plugins)
    struct ComponentVTable {
        void (*onAdd)(Entity e, const void* paramBlob, size_t bytes);
        void (*onRemove)(Entity e);
        void (*serialize)(Entity e, IWriter*);
        void (*tick)(Entity e, float dt); // optional, or system-based
    };

    struct SystemDescriptor {
        const char* name; // debug only
        void (*onRegister)(IWorld*);
        void (*onTick)(IWorld*, float dt);
        ComponentTypeId* readSet; // array of component type IDs
        ComponentTypeId* writeSet;
    };

    // Plugin entry points (Stable C ABI)
    extern "C" bool RegisterPlugin(PluginApi* api, uint32_t apiVersion);
    extern "C" void UnregisterPlugin(PluginApi* api);

    // AssetHotReloadSystem Tick Method
    void AssetHotReloadSystem::TickEndOfFrame()
    {
        if (watcher.hasChanges()) {
            Staging s;
            for (auto& change : watcher.consume()) {
                if (isXML(change)) cookToIR(change, s);
                if (isCode(change)) buildPluginSo(change, s); // optional remote build
            }
            // Build/update staging registry from IR (same passes as tool)
            buildStagingRegistry(s);

            // Commit atomically
            registry.swapWith(s.registry);
            pluginManager.commit(s.plugins); // dlopen/dlsym here
            eventBus.emit(HotReloadEvent{});
        }
    }
    ```
