Implementing a scene and asset compiler that outputs binaries for production while enabling caching and hot-swapping in debug mode requires a robust architecture that distinguishes between compile-time and runtime behaviors, while striving for a unified core logic. The existing C++ architecture, built on **IoC, ECS, and a mini-domain approach**, provides an excellent foundation for this.

Here's a detailed implementation plan, covering file structure, class interactions, the pipeline, and relevant code references.

### 1. Core Architectural Principles for the Compiler and Runtime

The design adheres to these foundational principles:

*   **Two Modes, One Codepath:** The runtime system (loading, patching, swapping) should ideally use a single code path. The distinction between debug and release lies in *how* assets are prepared and sourced: raw XML with live compilation/generation in debug, and pre-compiled binary packs in release.
*   **Strings Only at the Edges:** Raw XML and file paths exist primarily at compilation/import time. The runtime primarily uses **stable numeric IDs** (e.g., `uint32_t` or `uint64_t` for `AssetId`) for all assets, types, shaders, and systems, ensuring ultra-fast lookups.
*   **Deterministic Commits:** Any hot-swapped changes are batched and committed at a **frame boundary** (a single "sync point"), never mid-system update. This maintains simulation determinism.
*   **Thin Runtime, Fat Tools:** Complex tasks like validation, parametric meshing, compression, and other "cooking" steps are handled off-device by dedicated build tools. The runtime focuses on efficient loading and utilization.
*   **Modularity & Extensibility:** Leveraging **IoC** (via Dependency Injection), **ECS**, and **Event-Driven Communication** ensures clear separation of concerns, flexibility, and easy extension with new asset types or scene elements.

### 2. File and Folder Structure

### 3. Key Classes and Their Interactions

#### 3.1. Build Tools (Compile-Time)

These tools prepare assets for the runtime environment.

**3.1.1. `AssetCompiler` (CLI Tool)**
*   **Purpose:** Processes raw asset definitions (XML) into optimized runtime formats for production. In debug, it can convert to an in-memory Intermediate Representation (IR). It handles schema validation, parameter extraction, and various optimizations.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `bool ProcessAssetConfiguration(const std::string& configFile)`: Parses a package XML.
    *   `bool ValidateAgainstSchema(const std::string& xml, const std::string& schemaFile)`: Validates XML against XSD.
    *   `std::vector<Error> GetErrors() const`: Reports compilation errors.
    *   Internally, it orchestrates asset-specific cooking (e.g., mesh processing, texture compression).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Uses `AssetSchema` for XSD validation (conceptual class representing schema operations).
    *   Invokes generator classes (`VoxelMeshGenerator`, `ProceduralTextureGenerator`, `BasicShaderGenerator`) for **parametric asset cooking**.
    *   Outputs `.pak` binary files to `runtime/data/packs/`.

**3.1.2. `SceneCompiler` (CLI Tool)**
*   **Purpose:** Transforms high-level scene definitions (XML) into optimized runtime representations. It validates scene configurations, resolves asset references (using `AssetId`s from `AssetCompiler`), and optimizes scene graphs.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `bool CompileScene(const std::string& sceneFile)`: Main function to process a scene XML.
    *   `void OptimizeSceneGraph(SceneGraph& scene)`: Performs scene graph optimizations.
    *   `void ResolveAssetReferences(SceneGraph& scene)`: Ensures asset references are valid.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   References `AssetCompiler`'s output (specifically, `AssetId`s) to link scene elements to cooked assets.
    *   Outputs scene data into `.pak` files, potentially as a dedicated section.

**3.1.3. `Codegen Tool` (CLI Tool)**
*   **Purpose:** Generates C++ headers or binary lookup tables that map human-readable asset names/paths (from XML) to their **stable numeric `AssetId`s** used at runtime. This enforces the "strings only at the edges" principle.
*   **Interactions:** Reads asset and scene XMLs (or the IR from `AssetCompiler`) to gather all symbolic names requiring an `AssetId`. Outputs a `AssetIds.h` header file or a binary table.

#### 3.2. Runtime Asset Management (Core Engine Components)

These components are part of the `runtime/src/core/` and `runtime/src/platform/` directories.

**3.2.1. `AssetRegistry` (`core/AssetRegistry.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** The **central repository for all loaded assets** and scene configurations. It stores ownership (via `std::unique_ptr`) of processed assets and provides fast lookup using `AssetId`s. It's crucial for hot-reloading as it can be `clear()`ed and repopulated.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `void registerFont(AssetId id, std::unique_ptr<FontAsset> asset)`: Stores a font asset.
    *   `const TextureAsset* getTexture(AssetId id) const`: Retrieves a texture asset.
    *   `void registerSceneConfig(AssetId id, const std::string& sceneXml)`: Stores raw XML for scene configs (in debug) or a binary scene blob (in release).
    *   `void clear()`: Removes all registered assets and configurations. Essential for hot-reloading.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **`AssetPackLoader`** populates the `AssetRegistry`.
    *   **`WorldGenSystem`** queries it for scene configurations and material IDs.
    *   **`VisualizationSystem`** and other systems retrieve actual asset data (e.g., meshes, textures) for use.

**3.2.2. `AssetPackLoader` (`core/AssetPackLoader.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** The primary loader responsible for reading asset packages. In debug, it parses XML files. In release, it memory-maps and parses binary `.pak` files.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `bool loadPackage(const std::string& packagePath)`: Reads a package file, parses its contents, and registers assets.
    *   `bool parseAssets(const std::string& xmlContent, const std::string& packageName)`: Extracts and registers asset definitions from XML.
    *   `std::unique_ptr<TextureAsset> parseTextureAsset(const std::string& xmlNode)`: Parses specific asset types.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Uses **`IXmlParser`** (`PugiXmlParser`) for XML parsing in debug.
    *   **Registers assets and scene configurations into the `AssetRegistry`**.
    *   Invoked by **`BootstrapSystem`** at startup and **`AssetHotReloadSystem`** on detected changes.

**3.2.3. `IXmlParser` and `PugiXmlParser` (`platform/IXmlParser.h/.cpp`, `PugiXmlParser.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** `IXmlParser` defines a platform-independent interface for XML parsing, adhering to the IoC principle. `PugiXmlParser` is a concrete implementation using the pugixml library, injected into components needing XML parsing.
*   **Key Methods (`IXmlParser`):** `virtual bool loadFile(const std::string& path) = 0`.
*   **Interactions:** `AssetPackLoader` and `SceneConfigParser` would depend on this abstraction.

#### 3.3. ECS Systems for World Management and Hot-Reloading

These systems are located in `runtime/src/systems/`.

**3.3.1. `AssetHotReloadSystem` (`systems/AssetHotReloadSystem.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** An **ECS system dedicated to monitoring asset and scene files for changes during development**. It's the core of the debug hot-swapping functionality.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `void update(World &world, float deltaTime) override`: Called every frame; checks for file modifications.
    *   `void watchPackage(const std::string &packagePath)`: Adds a package file (XML) to its watch list.
    *   `bool checkForChanges()`: Compares current file modification times with recorded ones.
    *   `void reloadChangedPackages()`: Triggers the reload process by clearing the `AssetRegistry` and re-loading the package via `AssetPackLoader`.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Requires **`AssetRegistry` and `AssetPackLoader` injected** in its constructor.
    *   Runs at the **`EndOfFrame`** (after `VisualizationSystem`) to ensure atomic updates and avoid mid-frame mutations.
    *   Emits a `HotReloadEvent` (conceptual, via `EventBus`) to notify other systems of changes.

**3.3.2. `BootstrapSystem` (`systems/BootstrapSystem.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** A **one-shot system** that runs at application startup to initialize the world and load initial assets. It checks for available packages, loads them, and triggers world generation.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `void Init()`: Called once to perform initial package loading and default scene setup.
    *   `bool LoadAvailablePackages()`: Uses `AssetPackLoader` to load initial packages (e.g., `DeveloperPackage`).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Constructed with `EventBus`, `World`, `AssetRegistry`, and `AssetPackLoader`.
    *   Publishes `NoPackagesFoundEvent` or `DefaultWorldGeneratedEvent` via `EventBus`.

**3.3.3. `SceneConfigParser` (`config/SceneConfigParser.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** Parses XML scene configuration files into structured C++ data (`SceneConfig::Scene`). It handles schema validation and populates data structures like `Entity`, `Material`, `Animation`, etc..
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `ParseResult parseSceneFile(const std::string &filePath)`: Loads and parses a scene XML.
    *   `ParseResult parseSceneString(const std::string &xmlContent)`: Parses XML content directly.
    *   `bool validateAgainstSchema(const std::string &xmlContent, std::vector<std::string> &errors)`: Validates XML against the scene XSD schema.
    *   `std::shared_ptr<Entity> parseEntityFromXml(const std::string &xml)`: Parses an entity node from XML.
*   **Interactions:** Used by `WorldGenSystem` to interpret scene definitions from `AssetRegistry`.

**3.3.4. `WorldGenSystem` (`systems/WorldGenSystem.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** Responsible for instantiating the simulation world based on scene configurations. In debug, it uses `SceneConfigParser` to read XML and procedural generators to create objects. In release, it would load pre-compiled scene data.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `void GenerateDefaultSphereWorld()`: Creates a hardcoded fallback scene (e.g., Earth, Atmosphere, Clouds) if no config is found.
    *   `void LoadScene(const SceneConfig::Scene &sceneData)`: Iterates through `sceneData` to create ECS entities and attach components.
    *   `AssetId GenerateVoxelMesh(const SceneConfig::CompoundMesh &meshConfig)`: Bridges to `VoxelMeshGenerator` to create procedural meshes.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Subscribes to `NoPackagesFoundEvent` and `DefaultWorldGeneratedEvent` from `EventBus`.
    *   Uses its injected `SceneConfigParser`, `VoxelMeshGenerator`, `ProceduralTextureGenerator`, and `MaterialManager` to build the world.
    *   Adds newly created `Entities` (with `TransformC`, `RenderableC`, etc.) to the `World`.

**3.3.5. `VisualizationSystem` (`systems/VisualizationSystem.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** Renders the 3D scene, HUD, and debug overlays. It visualizes the current state of entities in the `World`.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `void update(World &world, float deltaTime) override`: Main rendering loop.
    *   `void RenderEntities()`: Iterates `World::getEntities()` to draw them based on `TransformC` and `RenderableC` components.
    *   `void OnNoPackagesFound(const NoPackagesFoundEvent &event)`: Updates internal flags to display messages.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Subscribes to `NoPackagesFoundEvent` and `ConsoleVisibilityChangedEvent`.
    *   Reads `TransformC` (position, orientation, scale) and `RenderableC` (mesh, material IDs, visibility) components from entities in the `World`.

#### 3.4. Generator Classes (Used by Compilers and `WorldGenSystem`)

These classes (`runtime/src/generators/`) encapsulate the logic for creating procedural assets.

**3.4.1. `VoxelMeshGenerator` (`generators/VoxelMeshGenerator.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** Generates procedural meshes (cubes, spheres, cylinders, planes, or compound meshes) from given parameters. Crucial for parametric buildings and other environmental elements.
*   **Key Methods:** `VoxelMesh::MeshData generatePrimitive(const VoxelMesh::VoxelParams &params)`, `VoxelMesh::MeshData generateCompound(const VoxelMesh::CompoundParams &params)`, `VoxelMesh::MeshData generateFromParameters(const std::string &type, const std::map<std::string, std::string> &parameters)`.
*   **Interactions:** Invoked by `AssetCompiler` (for cooking) and `WorldGenSystem` (for runtime generation).

**3.4.2. `ProceduralTextureGenerator` (`generators/ProceduralTextureGenerator.h/.cpp`)**
*   **Purpose:** Generates textures based on procedural definitions (noise, gradients, patterns, composites). Useful for terrain textures, clouds, etc.
*   **Key Methods:** `static TextureData generateTexture(const TextureParams &params)`, `static TextureData generateFromParameters(const std::string &type, const std::map<std::string, std::string> &parameters)`.
*   **Interactions:** Invoked by `AssetCompiler` (for baking textures) and `MaterialManager` (for dynamic textures in `WorldGenSystem`).

### 4. Best Possible Pipeline: Debug (Hot-Swap) vs. Release (Binaries)

#### 4.1. Development Mode (Debug) - Caching and Hot-Swap

The focus is on rapid iteration without restarting the application.

1.  **Authoring (XML):** Developers modify asset definitions in XML files (`assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/*.xml`, `assets/schemas/*.xsd`, `assets/params/*.xml`).
2.  **File Watching (`AssetHotReloadSystem`):**
    *   At startup, `BootstrapSystem` loads the `DeveloperPackage/package.xml`.
    *   `AssetHotReloadSystem` starts monitoring these XML source files for changes (e.g., `watchPackage("assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml")`).
3.  **Live Compilation & Generation (In-Memory):**
    *   When `AssetHotReloadSystem` detects a change (using `checkForChanges()` with file modification timestamps), it calls `reloadChangedPackages()`.
    *   `reloadChangedPackages()` clears the entire `AssetRegistry` (a simple approach for debug, more sophisticated would be incremental) and then invokes `AssetPackLoader::loadPackage()` on the changed XML.
    *   `AssetPackLoader` uses `IXmlParser` to parse the XML into an in-memory **Intermediate Representation (IR)**.
    *   For parametric assets, the loader (or helper functions) directly calls `VoxelMeshGenerator`, `ProceduralTextureGenerator`, or `BasicShaderGenerator` to produce in-memory mesh, texture, or shader data from the XML parameters.
    *   These live-generated assets are immediately registered in the (now cleared and re-populated) `AssetRegistry`.
4.  **Caching:** The `AssetRegistry` itself serves as the cache for these in-memory, live-compiled assets.
5.  **Hot Swapping (Atomic Commit):**
    *   Crucially, the `AssetHotReloadSystem::update()` method is called at the very end of the main simulation loop, *after* `VisualizationSystem` has finished rendering the current frame.
    *   The act of `AssetRegistry::clear()` and `AssetPackLoader::loadPackage()` effectively performs the "hot-swap" by replacing all old assets with new ones.
    *   **Notification:** A `HotReloadEvent` (via `EventBus`) is then published. Systems like `WorldGenSystem` would subscribe to this event and might re-instantiate entities or re-fetch asset data from the updated `AssetRegistry` to reflect the changes dynamically.
6.  **Development Package Scene Display:** By updating `package.xml` or referenced scene XMLs, developers can modify scene elements, material properties, procedural generation parameters, and instantly see the results in the `VisualizationSystem`'s output, thanks to this hot-reloading loop. For example, changing a `ProceduralAircraftGenerator`'s parameters in XML would cause the `WorldGenSystem` to regenerate the mesh, which `VisualizationSystem` would then render.

#### 4.2. Production Mode (Release) - Optimized Binaries

The focus is on performance, minimal memory footprint, and determinism on the ARM64 target.

1.  **Build Automation (CI/CD):** A build script (e.g., `build.ps1`/`build.sh`) orchestrates the compilation process.
2.  **Asset & Scene Compilation:**
    *   **`AssetCompiler`** (CLI tool): Processes all `package.xml` and associated asset files. It performs schema validation, resolves dependencies, bakes parametric assets (by running `VoxelMeshGenerator`, `ProceduralTextureGenerator`, etc. *once* at build time), applies aggressive optimizations (mesh quantization, texture compression to GPU-native formats like KTX2/ETC2, LOD generation).
    *   **`SceneCompiler`** (CLI tool): Processes scene XMLs. It links scene elements to their compiled `AssetId`s, performs scene graph optimizations, and bakes scene configuration data.
    *   **`Codegen Tool`** (CLI tool): Scans all asset/scene definitions and generates a C++ header (e.g., `AssetIds.h`) or a binary lookup table that maps symbolic names (e.g., "earth_albedo") to **unique, stable numeric `AssetId`s** (e.g., `0xDEADBEEF`). This header is then used in the C++ engine code for asset lookups.
3.  **Binary Pack Generation (`.pak` files):** All cooked assets (meshes, textures, materials, shader binaries) and compiled scene data are bundled into **compact, memory-mappable `.pak` files** (`runtime/data/packs/DeveloperPackage.pak`). The `.pak` format includes a header and a section directory for efficient lookup by `AssetId`.
4.  **Plugin Cross-Compilation:** Any C++ components or systems intended as plugins (following the "code modules" concept) are cross-compiled for ARM64 into shared object libraries (`.so`) using `aarch64-linux-gnu-g++`. These are placed in `runtime/data/plugins/`.
5.  **Runtime Loading (Fast & Deterministic):**
    *   `BootstrapSystem` initiates loading. `AssetPackLoader` uses **memory-mapped I/O** to load `.pak` files, directly exposing their sections without copying large amounts of data.
    *   `AssetRegistry` is populated with the binary data, using the pre-generated **numeric `AssetId`s** for all lookups.
    *   A conceptual `PluginManager` (not fully detailed in sources but implied by plugin architecture) scans `runtime/data/plugins/` and uses `dlopen()` to load `.so` files, registering their component `VTable`s and systems via a stable C ABI.
    *   `WorldGenSystem` instantiates entities from the pre-compiled scene data in the `AssetRegistry`, leveraging the numeric `AssetId`s for all asset references.
6.  **Simulation Execution:** The main loop proceeds as usual, with all systems operating on the highly optimized and pre-loaded assets. The "Strings only at the edges" principle means hot paths don't incur string overheads, contributing to performance.

This dual-pipeline approach provides the best of both worlds: rapid iteration during development and highly optimized, deterministic performance in production environments.
