 * @brief Resolve a collision using impulse-based calculations.

 * the component of velocity towards the surface. The impulse magnitude
 * is calculated based on the coefficient of restitution.

 * Note: This is currently a stub implementation. A full impulse-based
 * resolver would include friction calculations and proper impulse magnitude
 * determination based on object masses and collision geometry.

 * @param normalX X component of the surface normal vector
 * @param normalY Y component of the surface normal vector
 * @param normalZ Z component of the surface normal vector
 * @param restitution Coefficient of restitution for this collision
