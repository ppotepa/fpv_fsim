Executive Summary:

1.  **Direct Engine Dependence on Package Artifacts (High Risk)**: The engine's core components, such as `AssetRegistry` and `AssetPackLoader`, continue to utilize **string-based `AssetId`s** for runtime asset identification, despite architectural documentation mandating **numeric IDs**. Furthermore, specific package paths (e.g., `assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml`) are hardcoded within the `AssetHotReloadSystem` and `main.cpp`, directly coupling engine behavior to external package locations and names. This violates the principle of package-engine separation, hindering modularity and making the engine vulnerable to changes in package structure or naming.
2.  **Pervasive Use of Magic Numbers (High Risk)**: Numerous hardcoded numerical values are directly embedded across various systems. Examples include fixed physics timestep (`1.0f / 60.0f`), default parameters for air density, wind models, and collision resolvers, GUI positioning in `VisualizationSystem` (e.g., `rect.right / 2 - 100`), and direct array indexing for system retrieval (`world.getSystems()`, ``). This lack of symbolic constants or external configuration significantly reduces maintainability, makes tuning difficult, and introduces brittleness, as changes require code modification and recompilation rather than configuration updates.
3.  **Incomplete XML Parsing & Display Pipeline (High Risk)**: Key aspects of the configuration-driven development model are not fully realized. The `PugiXmlParser` contains a **"TODO: Implement actual XSD validation"**, allowing potentially malformed or invalid XML configurations to bypass formal checks. `WorldGenSystem::GenerateVoxelMesh` and `LoadSceneEntities` are **stubbed out** or have "TODO" comments, indicating that procedurally defined meshes are not generated, and scene entities from XML are not fully loaded or instantiated. This directly impacts the requirement that all parsed XML content is "compiled and displayed properly in the game windows."
4.  **Fragile XML String Parsing in AssetPackLoader (Medium Risk)**: The `AssetPackLoader` currently employs basic **string manipulation (e.g., `find("id=\"") + 4`, `find("</FontAsset>") + 8`) and regex** for parsing XML content. This approach is brittle, prone to errors from slight XML formatting changes, and deviates from the intended use of a robust XML library (`pugixml properly` as noted in a comment), risking incorrect or failed asset loading.
5.  **Non-Deterministic Hot-Reload Mechanism (Medium Risk)**: The `AssetHotReloadSystem` performs a **"full registry clear and reload"** for modified packages via `registry_.clear()`. This behavior deviates from the documented "deterministic commits" strategy, which mandates double-buffering and repointing handles at frame boundaries, potentially leading to transient invalid states or non-deterministic behavior during runtime asset updates.

| | **Inversion of Control (IoC) jako podstawa** realizowana przez **wstrzykiwanie zależności (Dependency Injection)**, głównie przez konstruktory. Systemy i komponenty będą polegać na abstrakcjach (interfejsach) zamiast na konkretnych implementacjach. | `main.cpp` | Deviates | `world.addSystem(...)` calls are not abstract, and `static_cast<BootstrapSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->Init();` uses magic number `3` (and `7` for `AssetHotReloadSystem`) for direct system access. | Hardcoded indices couple the system initialization order to concrete implementation details, bypassing the IoC container's intent for flexible system management. |
| | **Strings only at the edges.** Runtime uses **numeric IDs** (32-bit or 64-bit) for everything (assets, types, shaders, systems). | `src\core\AssetRegistry.h` | Deviates | `using AssetId = std::string; // Use string-based AssetId for now (backward compatibility)` is declared. `AssetRegistry` public methods (e.g., `registerFont`, `getFont`) all use `AssetId id`. | Continued reliance on `std::string` for `AssetId` at runtime in a core component contradicts a fundamental NFR, potentially impacting performance and consistency on ARM64 targets. |
| | **Schema Validation**: Validate against formal XSD schema. | `src\platform\PugiXmlParser.cpp::validateAgainstSchema` | Deviates | The method contains a "TODO: Implement actual XSD validation using external library" comment and currently returns true unconditionally for well-formedness. | Invalid XML configurations may be processed, leading to runtime errors, crashes, or incorrect simulation states that are difficult to diagnose. |
| | **Deterministic commits** for hot-reloading: changes are **batched** and **committed at a frame boundary** (a single “sync point”), never mid-system, using **double-buffering** and **indirection tables**. | `src\systems\AssetHotReloadSystem.cpp::reloadChangedPackages` | Deviates | `registry_.clear();` followed by `loader_.loadPackage(watched.path)` performs a full clear-and-reload, rather than a batched, double-buffered update. | This non-atomic update risks transient invalid states and non-deterministic behavior during asset updates, affecting stability and developer experience. |
| | No hardcoded values within engine codebase, configurations external via XML. Components populated directly from parsed XML values. | `src\main.cpp`; `src\systems\MaterialManager.cpp`; `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.cpp` | Deviates | Fixed numerical values are hardcoded for `SimClock` frequency (`1.0f / 60.0f`), air density parameters, wind model parameters, and collision resolver parameters. `MaterialManager` uses hardcoded default material properties. `WorldGenSystem` uses hardcoded world config parameters. `VisualizationSystem` uses hardcoded colors mapped to string material IDs. | Hardcoded values circumvent configuration-driven development, requiring code changes for parameter tuning and increasing coupling. |
| | XML Parsing and Data Loading: The C++ application would include a dedicated XML parsing module. The parsed XML data would be loaded into appropriate data structures. | `src\core\AssetPackLoader.cpp`; `src\config\SceneConfigParser.cpp` | Deviates | `AssetPackLoader` uses basic `string::find` and `substr` with magic offsets (e.g., `+4`, `+8`, `+15`) to parse XML. `SceneConfigParser` uses regex-based extraction `extractAttributeSimple` for attributes and section parsing. | This fragile string-based parsing is error-prone, sensitive to minor XML format changes, and is not a robust implementation of "dedicated XML parsing module" as indicated in comments within the code. |
| | **WorldGenSystem** manages the procedural generation and instancing of parametric assets (e.g., furniture). XML files define scene parameters and component properties. | `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.cpp` | Partial | `WorldGenSystem::LoadScene` contains "TODO: Implement proper XML scene loading when SceneConfigParser API is ready." `WorldGenSystem::GenerateVoxelMesh` states "TODO: Bridge to VoxelMeshGenerator when API is aligned" and returns `"generated_mesh_placeholder"`. | XML-driven procedural generation for meshes is not fully implemented, currently relying on placeholders, which means generated assets defined in XML are not compiled or displayed properly. |
| | Asset Compiler processes raw asset definitions into optimized runtime formats. Scene Compiler transforms scene definitions into optimized runtime representations. | `assets\build_tools\asset_compiler\main.cpp`; `assets\build_tools\codegen\main.cpp` | Deviates | Both asset compiler and codegen main functions contain "TODO: Implement XML -> IR -> cooked binaries" and "TODO: Generate headers/tables for AssetId mappings", indicating fundamental compilation steps are missing. | The essential build-time optimization and conversion steps for assets and scenes are not yet in place, preventing optimized runtime formats and potentially affecting proper display. |
| | **PhysicsSystem**: Numerical Integration applies **Semi-implicit Euler** with a **fixed timestep** (fixed_dt). | `src\main.cpp` | Aligned | `SimClock simClock(1.0f / 60.0f); // 60Hz physics` explicitly sets a fixed timestep. | Ensures deterministic and stable simulation as per NFRs. |

Logic Findings:

| ID | Severity | Use Case | Observed | Expected (Doc.Ref) | Evidence | Risk/Blast Radius |
| :-- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| L06 | High | System Access and Initialization | Systems like `BootstrapSystem` and `AssetHotReloadSystem` are accessed and initialized via magic index numbers (`world.getSystems().get()`, `world.getSystems().get()`). | IoC/Dependency Injection is the fundamental architectural principle, with systems relying on abstractions, not hardcoded positions. | `main.cpp`: `static_cast<BootstrapSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->Init();` `static_cast<AssetHotReloadSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->watchPackage(...)`. | This creates a brittle dependency on the order of system registration, making system reordering or removal highly error-prone and leading to runtime crashes (e.g., `bad_cast`, `nullptr` dereference) if indices change. |
| L07 | High | Hot-Reload Package Path Dependency | The `AssetHotReloadSystem` is configured to watch a specific, hardcoded package XML path (`"assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml"`). | The engine should be decoupled from specific package details, functioning as a "master" to "slave" packages. [User Query: "assets packages work as master slave, and engine should never depened on packages"] | `main.cpp`: `static_cast<AssetHotReloadSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->watchPackage("assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml");`. | Changes to the `DeveloperPackage` path or name require engine code modification, violating modularity and the principle of engine independence from packages. This restricts the hot-reload functionality to a single, predefined package. |
| L08 | Medium | Material Property Parsing Robustness | `MaterialManager::ParseIntProperty` and `ParseBoolProperty` use `try-catch (const std::exception &e)` to handle parsing errors but print to `std::cerr` and return default values, without explicitly signaling parsing failure to the caller. | Robust parsing methods typically return a `bool` status or `std::optional` to indicate success/failure, ensuring callers are aware of parsing outcomes. | `src\systems\MaterialManager.cpp`: `std::cerr << "Error parsing float property " << propName << ": " << e.what() << std::endl;` and `intValue = std::stoi(value);`. | Invalid or malformed integer/boolean properties in material XML files will be silently converted to default values, leading to subtle visual discrepancies or incorrect material behavior in the game window without explicit error propagation. |
| L09 | Low | Procedural Mesh Generation Stub | `WorldGenSystem::GenerateVoxelMesh` is a stub method that returns a placeholder string (`"generated_mesh_placeholder"`). | Procedural mesh generation for parametric assets (e.g., furniture) is expected to be implemented and integrated with XML definitions. | `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.cpp`: `// TODO: Bridge to VoxelMeshGenerator when API is aligned` and `return "generated_mesh_placeholder";`. | XML-defined procedural meshes will not be accurately generated or displayed, limiting the dynamic content capabilities of the world generation system and preventing full validation of XML-driven asset display. |
| L10 | High | Fixed Physics Timestep Magic Number | The `SimClock` is initialized with a hardcoded fixed timestep (`1.0f / 60.0f`). | While a fixed timestep of 60Hz is documented as an NFR for physics, this value should ideally be configurable or derived from a symbolic constant, not a magic number in `main.cpp`. | `src\main.cpp`: `SimClock simClock(1.0f / 60.0f); // 60Hz physics`. | Changing the simulation frequency requires recompiling `main.cpp`. This reduces flexibility for testing different physics rates or adapting to varying performance targets across platforms. |
| L11 | High | Physics Model Parameter Magic Numbers | Concrete implementations of physics models (`airDensityModel`, `windModel`, `collisionResolver`) are instantiated with hardcoded numerical values. | Parameters for physics models should be configurable, ideally loaded from XML or a central configuration, rather than being hardcoded in `main.cpp`. | `src\main.cpp`: `std::make_unique<ExponentialAirDensityModel>(1.225f, 8500.0f);`, `std::make_unique<PerlinWindModel>(5.0f, 100.0f, 10.0f, 12345);`, `std::make_unique<ImpulseCollisionResolver>(0.2f, 0.8f);`. | These magic numbers make it impossible to reconfigure fundamental physics behavior without recompiling the engine, severely limiting iteration speed and testability for physics tuning. |
| L12 | High | Visualization System Material Color Magic Numbers | The `VisualizationSystem` uses a hardcoded `std::unordered_map<std::string, COLORREF> materialColors` to map string asset IDs (e.g., "earth_material_1000", "AircraftBodyMaterial") to fixed RGB color values. | Material properties, including colors, should be loaded from XML configuration files and rendered dynamically. | `src\systems\VisualizationSystem.cpp`: `materialColors = {{"earth_material_1000", RGB(34, 139, 34)}, ...}`. | This creates a direct dependency between rendering logic and specific asset string IDs, bypassing XML-defined material properties and using magic numbers for colors. Changes to material colors in XML will not be reflected, and new materials will not be colored without code modification. |
| L13 | Medium | World Generation System Hardcoded WorldConfig | The `WorldGenSystem` contains a hardcoded `WorldConfig` struct with default numerical parameters (e.g., `earthRadius = 6371000.0f`, `atmosphereDensity = 0.1f`, `cloudCoverage = 0.6f`). | While XML loading for these parameters is present, the presence of hardcoded defaults and direct use of these defaults in fallback scenarios indicate a reliance on magic numbers when external configuration fails. | `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.h`: struct `WorldConfig` definition. `src\systems\WorldGenSystemConfig.cpp`: `worldConfig_.earthRadius = ExtractFloatValue(xmlContent, "...", 6371000.0f);`. | If `world_gen_config.xml` is missing or fails to load, the system falls back to these magic numbers, limiting dynamic world generation and testing of various world configurations. |

SOLID Findings:

| ID | Principle | File:Line/Class | Symptom | Why it violates | Impact |
| :-- | :-------- | :-------------- | :------ | :--------------- | :----- |
| S04 | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | `src\core\AssetPackLoader.cpp` | The `parseAssets` method (and similarly `parseConfigurations`) in `AssetPackLoader` is responsible for finding the "Assets" section within a raw XML string, performing basic string-based parsing (extracting `id`, `path`, `size`, `antialiasing`, `format`, `mipmaps`, `filter`, `shaderId`, `generator`), and then registering these parsed assets with the `AssetRegistry`. | This method has multiple reasons to change: if the XML structure for asset definitions changes (e.g., a new tag is introduced, an attribute name changes), if the logic for extracting asset properties from XML strings changes (e.g., a switch to a proper XML DOM parser), or if the way assets are registered in the `AssetRegistry` is modified. It's doing string parsing and asset data extraction simultaneously. | This high coupling makes `AssetPackLoader` fragile to external XML format changes and internal parsing logic updates. Any such change requires modifying this central method, increasing the risk of introducing bugs and making maintenance more complex than if these responsibilities were separated (e.g., one component for XML DOM traversal, another for mapping DOM nodes to asset data structures). |
| S05 | Open/Closed Principle (OCP) | `src\core\AssetPackLoader.cpp` | The `parseAssets` method contains hardcoded loops and `string::find` calls for specific asset types (FontAsset, TextureAsset, MaterialAsset, MeshRecipeAsset). | Adding a new asset type (e.g., `AudioAsset`) would require modifying the `parseAssets` method to include new `while ((pos = assetsSection.find("<AudioAsset"))` blocks and new `parseAudioAsset` calls. This means the method is *closed to extension* without *modification* of its existing code. | This violates OCP by forcing modifications to a core parsing logic every time a new asset type is introduced, increasing maintenance overhead and the potential for bugs in existing, stable parsing logic. It works against the data-driven design intent for extensibility. |
| S06 | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) | `src\platform\IXmlParser.h` | The `IXmlParser` interface is relatively broad, including `loadFile`, `loadString`, `getRootElementName`, `hasElement`, `getElementText`, `getElementsWithName`, `getElementAttribute`, `setElementAttribute`, `validateAgainstSchema`, `getLastError`, and `clear`. | Clients that only need to load XML (e.g., `AssetPackLoader`) are forced to depend on methods for querying attributes, validating schemas, or manipulating elements (like `setElementAttribute`) which they do not use. Similarly, a validation-only client would still depend on load/query methods. | This "fat" interface forces implementers (e.g., `PugiXmlParser`) and consumers to deal with methods irrelevant to their specific needs, increasing the surface area for dependency and potentially leading to more complex or incomplete implementations for unused methods (as seen with `validateAgainstSchema` being a "TODO"). |

Open Questions:

| Item | What’s unclear | Needed doc/page/section |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| Asset ID Generation Strategy (Numeric vs. String) | The `AssetRegistry.h` explicitly uses `using AssetId = std::string;` for "backward compatibility", contradicting the "strings only at the edges" principle and the `AssetIdGenerator` generating `uint32_t` IDs. It's unclear how these two conflicting approaches are meant to reconcile or if there's a detailed plan for migrating `AssetRegistry` to numeric IDs. | An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) detailing the backward compatibility strategy, migration plan, and timeline for the `AssetRegistry` to fully adopt numeric `AssetId`s. |
| Full XML Scene Loading Workflow | The `WorldGenSystem` contains `TODO` comments for implementing proper XML scene loading and `LoadSceneEntities`. The `SceneConfigParser` also exists, but its full integration with `WorldGenSystem` to load and instantiate all entities and components from XML is not evident. It's unclear what specific steps or components are missing to achieve the "everything we parse from XML files is compiled and displayed properly" goal for scenes. | A comprehensive "Scene Loading and Instantiation Flow" document, detailing the responsibilities of `SceneConfigParser`, `WorldGenSystem`, and `Entity Factory/Spawner` in translating XML scene data into runtime entities. |
| Error Handling and Fallback Strategy for XML Parsing | The current XML parsing (especially in `AssetPackLoader` and `MaterialManager`) relies on `string::find` or regex, and error handling often involves `std::cerr` and returning `false` or default values. A consistent, system-wide strategy for handling parsing errors, propagating them, and defining robust fallback behaviors (beyond simple default values) when XML assets or configurations are invalid or malformed is unclear. | An "Error Handling and Fault Tolerance Strategy" document, specifically addressing XML parsing failures, explicit error reporting mechanisms, and defined fallback or recovery procedures. |

---------------------

Executive Summary:
1.  **Incomplete XML Scene Loading and Display Pipeline**: The `WorldGenSystem` explicitly contains "TODO" comments for proper XML scene loading and entity instantiation, leading to a fallback to hardcoded default scene generation methods [source-15-9-2025.txt:300, 301, 319, 340, 341, 678, 700, 707]. The `SceneConfigParser` utilizes rudimentary string/regex parsing with acknowledged "basic implementation" [source-15-9-2025.txt:105, 121, 150, 456, 484, 490], and `PugiXmlParser` lacks formal XSD schema validation [source-15-9-2025.txt:570, 571]. This collective state prevents XML-defined scenes from being "compiled and displayed properly" and forces reliance on hardcoded entity creation, undermining configuration-driven development.
2.  **Pervasive Use of Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Values**: Critical engine parameters, such as physics timestep (`1.0f / 60.0f`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:201, 724], physics model coefficients (e.g., air density `1.225f`, wind model `5.0f`, `100.0f`, `10.0f`, `12345`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:202, 724, 725], and collision resolver parameters (`0.2f`, `0.8f`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:202, 725], are hardcoded in `main.cpp`. System retrieval in `main.cpp` uses magic array indices (e.g., `world.getSystems()`, `world.getSystems()`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:204, 205, 727]. `MaterialManager` loads "hardcoded default materials" if XML loading fails [source-15-9-2025.txt:263, 633] and `VisualizationSystem` uses a hardcoded `std::unordered_map` for material colors mapped to string IDs [source-15-9-2025.txt:599, 659]. This extensively violates the "no hardcoded values" principle and significantly reduces configurability and maintainability.
3.  **Direct Engine Dependency on Specific Package Path**: The `AssetHotReloadSystem` is configured in `main.cpp` to specifically watch `"assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml"` [source-15-9-2025.txt:205, 727]. This hardcoded path creates a direct coupling between the core engine and a specific package, contradicting the "master-slave" relationship where the engine should not depend on explicit package locations or names. This limits flexibility and requires code changes for package structure modifications.
4.  **Asset ID Type Inconsistency**: The `AssetRegistry` explicitly defines `AssetId` as `std::string` for "backward compatibility" [source-15-9-2025.txt:176, 533], despite architectural principles mandating "numeric IDs (32-bit or 64-bit) for everything (assets, types, shaders, systems)" at runtime. This inconsistency introduces string-based comparisons and lookups in core asset management, potentially impacting performance and determinism on resource-constrained ARM64 targets, and complicates the transition to compiled binary packs.

Physics model parameters (e.g., `ExponentialAirDensityModel(1.225f, 8500.0f)`). `materialColors` map hardcoded `std::string` IDs to `COLORREF` values (e.g., `{"earth_material_1000", RGB(34, 139, 34)}`). `MaterialManager::LoadDefaultMaterials` falls back to hardcoded materials. `WorldGenSystem::GenerateDefaultSphereWorld` uses hardcoded `Math::float3` positions for entities. | This widespread hardcoding makes tuning and modification impossible without recompilation, directly violates a core architectural principle, and introduces brittleness. |
| | **Asset and Scene Compilers** transform high-level configuration files (XML) into **optimized runtime formats**. "All parsed XML content is compiled and displayed properly in the game windows". | `assets\build_tools\asset_compiler\main.cpp`; `assets\build_tools\codegen\main.cpp` | Deviates | Both asset compiler and codegen main functions contain `// TODO: Implement XML -> IR -> cooked binaries` and `// TODO: Generate headers/tables for AssetId mappings`. This indicates fundamental compilation steps are missing. | The absence of a functional compilation pipeline for XML means that configuration changes are not effectively converted to optimized runtime formats, hindering performance and the ability to properly display XML-defined content. |
| | **Schema Validation**: Validate against formal XSD schema. | `src\platform\PugiXmlParser.cpp::validateAgainstSchema` | Deviates | The method contains `// TODO: Implement actual XSD validation using external library` and currently only performs a basic well-formedness check. `SceneConfigParser` has `ParserConfig::validateSchema = true` but the implementation itself relies on simple string/regex parsing. | Untested or invalid XML configurations may lead to runtime errors or incorrect display without detection, directly impacting the integrity of displayed assets and scenes. |
| | **Strings only at the edges.** Runtime uses **numeric IDs** (32-bit or 64-bit) for everything (assets, types, shaders, systems). | `src\core\AssetRegistry.h`; `src\core\AssetPackLoader.cpp` | Deviates | `using AssetId = std::string; // Use string-based AssetId for now (backward compatibility)` is declared. `AssetPackLoader` extracts asset IDs from XML using string manipulation (e.g., `find("id=\"") + 4`). `VisualizationSystem` uses `std::string` material IDs in a hardcoded `std::unordered_map`. | The continued use of `std::string` for `AssetId` in core runtime components introduces performance overhead from string comparisons and diverges from the fundamental architecture principle for performance and determinism. |
| | **Deterministic commits** for hot-reloading: changes are **batched** and **committed at a frame boundary** (a single “sync point”), never mid-system, using **double-buffering** and **indirection tables**. | `src\systems\AssetHotReloadSystem.cpp::reloadChangedPackages` | Deviates | `registry_.clear();` and subsequent `loader_.loadPackage(watched.path)` performs a full clear-and-reload for changed packages, directly contradicting the expected batched, double-buffered update. | This non-atomic update risks transient invalid states, non-deterministic behavior, or visual glitches during asset updates, impacting stability and developer experience in debug mode. |
| | **BootstrapSystem** is responsible for initial world construction and asset loading. | `src\systems\BootstrapSystem.cpp::Init` | Partial | `LoadAvailablePackages` is called, which then loads `DeveloperPackage/package.xml`. `assetRegistry_.getDefaultScene()` is checked. If `defaultScene` is `nullptr` or an exception occurs during `LoadScene`, `NoPackagesFoundEvent{}` is published, leading to `GenerateDefaultSphereWorld()`. `WorldGenSystem::LoadScene` contains `// TODO: Implement proper XML scene loading` and currently calls `GenerateDefaultSphereWorld()` or `GenerateLoadingIndicatorWorld()`. | The system successfully falls back to *generating* a default world (either sphere or loading indicator) if XML loading is not ready or packages are absent. However, it is not *loading and displaying* an XML-defined scene. |
| | **XML Parsing and Data Loading:** C++ application includes a dedicated XML parsing module. Parsed XML data loaded into appropriate data structures. | `src\core\AssetPackLoader.cpp`; `src\config\SceneConfigParser.cpp` | Deviates | `AssetPackLoader` uses basic `string::find` and `substr` with magic offsets (e.g., `+4`, `+8`) to extract data from XML asset definitions. `SceneConfigParser` uses regex-based `extractAttributeSimple`. | This fragile string-based parsing is error-prone, sensitive to minor XML format changes, and is not a robust implementation of a "dedicated XML parsing module" (as acknowledged by comments in `SceneConfigParser`). |
| | **WorldGenSystem** manages procedural generation of world (terrain, buildings, wind fields). | `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.cpp::GenerateVoxelMesh` | Deviates | The method is a stub: `// TODO: Bridge to VoxelMeshGenerator when API is aligned` and returns `"generated_mesh_placeholder"`. | Procedurally defined meshes from XML are not actually generated or displayed, severely limiting dynamic content generation and the visual representation of configurable assets. |
| | Debug mode can wait for a package to appear in package folder. | `src\main.cpp::main` | Partial | `AssetHotReloadSystem` is explicitly set to `watchPackage("assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml")`. This enables watching a specific package, but there is no explicit wait mechanism beyond the hot-reload loop. The system instead *generates* a default scene if no packages are loaded or if default scene XML cannot be loaded. | The system attempts to load existing packages and watch a specific one, but it does not "wait" for a package to appear; instead, it generates a default scene. The `AssetHotReloadSystem` allows for dynamic updates once the watched package changes, which aligns with debug iteration. |

Logic Findings:

| ID | Severity | Use Case | Observed | Expected (Doc.Ref) | Evidence | Risk/Blast Radius |
| :-- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| L14 | High | XML Scene Loading and Entity Instantiation | `WorldGenSystem::LoadScene` contains a `TODO` for implementing proper XML scene loading and `LoadSceneEntities` is also a `TODO` [source-15-9-2025.txt:300, 301, 319, 340, 341, 678, 700, 707]. It currently falls back to `GenerateDefaultSphereWorld()` or `GenerateLoadingIndicatorWorld()` [source-15-9-2025.txt:300, 319, 340, 678, 700, 704]. | All parsed XML content is expected to be "compiled and displayed properly in the game windows" [User Query], implying XML-defined scenes and their entities should be loaded and instantiated from configuration files. | The explicit `TODO` comments in `WorldGenSystem` functions related to XML scene and entity loading. The reliance on `GenerateDefaultSphereWorld()` for scene initialization. | XML-defined main scenes will not load or display, preventing configuration-driven scene design and forcing reliance on hardcoded default generation. This directly impacts the core requirement for dynamic scene content. |
| L15 | High | Hardcoded Physics Parameters | The `SimClock` is initialized with `1.0f / 60.0f` [source-15-9-2025.txt:201, 724], and physics models (`ExponentialAirDensityModel`, `PerlinWindModel`, `ImpulseCollisionResolver`) are constructed with hardcoded numerical values (e.g., `1.225f`, `8500.0f`, `5.0f`, `100.0f`, `10.0f`, `12345`, `0.2f`, `0.8f`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:202, 724, 725]. | "No hardcoded values exist within the engine codebase". Parameters for physics models should be configurable, ideally loaded from XML. Physics should operate at a fixed 60Hz timestep. | Direct initialization of `SimClock` and physics model unique pointers with literal float/int values in `main.cpp`. | Changes to fundamental simulation parameters require recompilation, hindering rapid iteration for physics tuning and testing. This is a severe violation of configuration-driven design and the "no hardcoded values" NFR. |
| L16 | High | Hardcoded System Access | `BootstrapSystem` and `AssetHotReloadSystem` are retrieved and initialized using magic array indices (`world.getSystems().get()` and `world.getSystems().get()`) in `main.cpp` [source-15-9-2025.txt:204, 205, 727]. | Systems are expected to be managed via an IoC container and rely on abstractions, not hardcoded positions in a vector. | `static_cast<BootstrapSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->Init();` `static_cast<AssetHotReloadSystem*>(world.getSystems().get())->watchPackage(...)` in `main.cpp`. | This creates a brittle dependency on the order of system registration. Any change in system order will lead to runtime crashes (e.g., `bad_cast`, `nullptr` dereference) or incorrect system initialization, making system management fragile. |
| L17 | Medium | Inconsistent Asset ID Usage | The `AssetRegistry` stores and retrieves assets using `AssetId` defined as `std::string` [source-15-9-2025.txt:176, 533]. This is explicitly noted for "backward compatibility." | "Runtime uses numeric IDs (32-bit or 64-bit) for everything (assets, types, shaders, systems)". `AssetIdGenerator` generates `uint32_t` IDs. | `using AssetId = std::string;` in `src\core\AssetRegistry.h` with comment, and all `register`/`get` methods in `AssetRegistry` take `std::string AssetId`. | This inconsistency introduces string comparison overhead in core asset lookups, potentially impacting performance on ARM64 targets, and complicates the intended runtime use of numeric IDs from compiled `.pak` files. |
| L18 | High | Hardcoded Material Colors in Visualization | The `VisualizationSystem` uses a hardcoded `std::unordered_map<std::string, COLORREF> materialColors` to map string-based material IDs (e.g., "earth_material_1000", "AircraftBodyMaterial") to fixed RGB color values [source-15-9-2025.txt:599, 659]. | Material properties, including colors, are expected to be loaded dynamically from XML configuration files and properly displayed. | `materialColors = {{"earth_material_1000", RGB(34, 139, 34)}, ...}` initialization in `VisualizationSystem` constructor. | Visual elements relying on these materials will display colors based on hardcoded values rather than XML configurations, leading to a disconnect between configuration and visual output. New XML-defined materials will not have colors unless added to this map. |
| L19 | Medium | Fragile XML Parsing with Magic Offsets | `AssetPackLoader::parseAssets` and `parseConfigurations` use `string::find("id=\"") + 4` and other fixed offsets (e.g., `+8`, `+15`) with `substr` to extract XML data [source-15-9-2025.txt:159, 160, 164, 516, 517, 520]. This is explicitly commented as "Simple XML parsing - in a real implementation this would use pugixml properly" [source-15-9-2025.txt:158, 515]. | A "dedicated XML parsing module" using a robust library is expected. XML parsing should be robust and extensible, not reliant on magic string offsets. | Direct string manipulation with magic numbers in `AssetPackLoader.cpp` to extract attributes and sections. | Minor changes to XML formatting (e.g., whitespace, attribute order) can break parsing, leading to asset loading failures and potentially preventing scenes from loading or displaying correctly. |
| L20 | Medium | Debug Mode Package Dependence | `main.cpp` explicitly calls `hotReloadSystem->watchPackage("assets/packages/DeveloperPackage/package.xml")` [source-15-9-2025.txt:205, 727]. This hardcodes the watched package for hot-reloading in debug mode. | The engine should treat packages as "slaves" and not depend on their specific paths or names [User Query]. While hot-reloading is desired in debug, the mechanism should be more generic. | Hardcoded string literal for `packagePath` in `main.cpp` for `AssetHotReloadSystem`. | Modifying the path or name of the `DeveloperPackage` requires recompiling `main.cpp`. This restricts dynamic debugging workflows and ties the engine to a specific package structure. |

SOLID Findings:

| ID | Principle | File:Line/Class | Symptom | Why it violates | Impact |
| :-- | :-------- | :-------------- | :------ | :--------------- | :----- |
| S07 | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | `src\systems\WorldGenSystem.cpp` (and .h) | `WorldGenSystem` is responsible for loading scene configurations, generating default worlds, generating loading indicator worlds, and potentially managing procedural mesh and texture generation through injected generators, as well as handling event subscriptions for world generation. | The class has multiple distinct reasons to change: if the default world generation logic changes, if the loading indicator logic changes, if the XML scene loading mechanism changes (e.g., `SceneConfigParser` API updates), or if the underlying mesh/texture generation strategies evolve. It mixes orchestration with specific generation implementations (even if stubbed). | This class's broad set of responsibilities makes it complex and fragile. A change in any single aspect of world generation or scene loading (e.g., new default scene requirements, different procedural generation algorithms) would necessitate modifying this class, increasing maintenance burden and the risk of introducing bugs across unrelated features. |
| S08 | Open/Closed Principle (OCP) | `src\systems\MaterialManager.cpp::LoadDefaultMaterials` | The `LoadDefaultMaterials` method contains explicit, hardcoded definitions for specific materials (e.g., "EarthSurfaceMaterial", "AtmosphereMaterial", "CloudMaterial", "ContrailMaterial") [source-15-9-2025.txt:264-267, 634-636]. | If a new default material type is needed, or if existing default material properties change, this method must be modified. This means the system is *closed to extension* without *modification* of its existing code. It also directly falls back to hardcoded values when file loading fails. | Adding new default materials or modifying existing ones requires recompilation of the `MaterialManager`, hindering extensibility and rapid iteration for content creation. This tightly couples material definitions to code rather than external configuration. |
| S09 | Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) | `src\main.cpp` | `main.cpp`, a high-level module coordinating the application's systems, directly instantiates concrete implementations of physics models (`ExponentialAirDensityModel`, `PerlinWindModel`, `ImpulseCollisionResolver`) and input devices (`WinInputDevice`) [source-15-9-2025.txt:202, 724, 725]. It then passes references to these concrete types to system constructors. | High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete details. By directly creating concrete instances, `main.cpp` is coupled to low-level implementation details rather than relying on an IoC container to provide abstractions (e.g., `IAirDensityModel`, `IInputDevice`). | This direct instantiation violates DIP by tightly coupling the application's entry point to specific implementations. Changing a physics model or input device requires modifying `main.cpp`, reducing flexibility and making it harder to swap implementations (e.g., for different platforms or testing). |

Open Questions:

| Item | What’s unclear | Needed doc/page/section |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| Full XML Scene Loading Workflow & Instantiation | Given the `TODO` comments in `WorldGenSystem::LoadScene` and `LoadSceneEntities`, and the rudimentary parsing in `SceneConfigParser`, the complete, functional workflow for loading an entire scene (including all its entities, components, and their properties) from an XML file and displaying it correctly in the game window is unclear. It is not evident how the parsed `SceneConfig::Scene` data structure is fully translated into actual ECS entities and their corresponding `RenderableC` and `TransformC` components. | A comprehensive "Scene Loading and Instantiation Flow" document, detailing the responsibilities of `SceneConfigParser`, `WorldGenSystem`, and a potential `Entity Factory/Spawner` in translating XML scene data into runtime entities, and how generated meshes/textures are linked. |
| Legacy AssetId Migration Plan | The `AssetRegistry` continues to use `std::string` for `AssetId` due to "backward compatibility" [source-15-9-2025.txt:176, 533], despite the architectural principle for numeric IDs and the `AssetIdGenerator` producing `uint32_t` IDs. A concrete plan, timeline, or strategy for fully migrating the `AssetRegistry` and all its consumers to the intended numeric `AssetId` system is not provided. | An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) or a dedicated migration plan document detailing the strategy, timeline, and associated risks for transitioning `AssetRegistry` and its consumers to `uint32_t` `AssetId`. |
| Debug Mode "Waiting" for Packages | The query states: "in debug mode we can wait for a package to appear in package folder (but thats not a must)". While `AssetHotReloadSystem` watches a specific package path [source-15-9-2025.txt:205, 727], there is no explicit "waiting" mechanism described. Instead, the `BootstrapSystem` proceeds with default world generation if no packages are initially found or loaded [source-15-9-2025.txt:601, 602]. The exact expectation for "waiting" in debug mode and how it should interact with the hot-reload system and default scene fallback is unclear. | Clarification in "Asset and Scene Compiler Design Document" (Section 4.3 "Hot Reloading Support" or "Debug Mode Behavior") or `Implementation Plan` about the specific "wait" behavior for packages in debug mode. |
